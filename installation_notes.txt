Windows people:
===============
if you get the message 'please stop it first', then delete
     instance.lock and instance.pid in var

Running in foreground will by default set debug mode to be on for
resource registries.  This is tragically slow; Turn off registry
debugging in ZMI at /portal_css  and at /portal_javascripts (th
must be done after every server start).

You could also do the following to boost Windows performance radically:
    In file: Products/CMFCore.DirectoryView:
    In function: DirectoryInformation._changed():
    comment out the whole whole block that begins with:
        if platform == 'win32':

    (this workaround will no longer be needed in Plone 4.2, i.e. CMF 2.3)
