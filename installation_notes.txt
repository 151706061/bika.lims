Installing Bika LIMS
====================

1. Install Plone 4
2. Edit instance/buildout.cfg:
   Add "bika.lims" in the "eggs=" section
   Add the following configuration to the [instance] section:

environment-vars =
    IDServerURL http://localhost:8081

3. Run bin/buildout
4. Enable Bika LIMS in Plone's Add-on control panel.

Plone 4 development setup
=========================

1. Install Plone 4
2. Download the bika3 repository to a folder called bika.lims
3. Edit instance/buildout.cfg:
   Add "path/to/working/copy" in the "develop=" section
   Add "bika.lims" in the "eggs=" section
   Add the following configuration to the [instance] section:

environment-vars =
    IDServerURL http://localhost:8081

5. Run bin/buildout -n -c develop.cfg
6. Run bin/plonectl fg
7. Load sample data with url/load_setup_data
8. Make sure the idserver is running
9. Load sample data with url/load_setup_data

If filestorage files have been deleted, 
run bin\plonectl adduser admin admin to create the admin user

Windows people:
===============
if you get the message 'please stop it first', then delete
     instance.lock and instance.pid in var

Running in foreground will by default set debug mode to be on for
resource registries.  This is tragically slow; Turn off registry
debugging in ZMI at /portal_css  and at /portal_javascripts (th
must be done after every server start).

You could also do the following to boost Windows performance radically:
    In file: Products/CMFCore.DirectoryView:
    In function: DirectoryInformation._changed():
    comment out the whole whole block that begins with:
        if platform == 'win32':


    (this workaround will no longer be needed in Plone 4.2, i.e. CMF 2.3)


Updating the demo:
on bika2 in usr/local/Plone
run in zinstance: sudo bin/svnupdate_and_rebuild
Which will clear db, get fresh copy from svn and rebuild, and start in fg
If all ok, break, and restart with sudo plone -c "bin/plonectl start"
