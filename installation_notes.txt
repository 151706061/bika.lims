Installing plone4

1. Install plone 4
2. download the bika3 repository
3. edit instance/buildout.cfg adding "bika.lims" in the "eggs=" section,
and "path/to/working/copy" in "develop=" section.
4. The egg doesn't interact with the buildout cfg at all, so the
      IDServerURL needs to be added by inserting the following in buildout.cfg
      somewhere after "parts=" :

      [instance]
      environment-vars =
      IDServerURL http://localhost:8081


5. run bin/buildout
6. run bin/plonectl fg

7. if you get the message 'please stop it first', then delete
     instance.lock and instance.pid in var

8. Running in foreground will by default set debug mode to be on.
In windows, debugging resource registries is tragically slow; Turn
off registry debugging in ZMI at /portal_css  and at /portal_javascripts

9. Load sample data with url/load_setup_data
