<div>
To safeguard the quality of laboratory data, CALA assess participating laboratories to the ISO/IEC 17025 standard in accordance with the ISO/IEC 17011 standard. The granting of CALA accreditation requires a laboratory to successfully complete an initial site assessment and to maintain accreditation the laboratory must successfully complete a site visit a year following the initial visit and every two years thereafter.  Site visits are conducted by highly trained volunteer assessors who are selected for their strong analytical backgrounds. Each assessor must undergo comprehensive and formal training on both ISO and Canadian requirements.

CALA is a Full member of the Asia Pacific Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (APLAC) and a signatory to the APLAC Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA) for testing. It is also a Full member of ILAC, i.e. a signatory also to the ILAC MRA for testing. These international agreements provide mutual recognition between almost 60 accrediting bodies in 40 countries in Africa, the Asia Pacific region, the Americas, Europe and the Middle East. The main aim of these agreements is increased worldwide use and acceptance by both industry and government of endorsed reports from accredited laboratories - "a product tested once and accepted everywhere".
