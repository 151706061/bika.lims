<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Bika 3 <a class="external-link" href="http://www.vanhunks.com/lowveld1/modjadji1.html">Modjadji</a> is Bika's long awaited upgrade to Plone 4 and SQL</p>
<p>The opportunity was used to undertake a massive code restructuring in    the interest of future maintenance and performance, as well as adding    much desired new functionality</p>

<h3 class="Subheading">Coming soon: Set-up data load scripts</h3>
<p>We are currently working on standardised  spreadsheets that can be used   to populate the LIMS with setup data of  your choice. We hope to have   these pre-populated for each Bika branch,  e.g. Water, Health, etc.</p>
<p>For the purpose of testing, we'll use the scripts to populate this  test   instance with consistent data consisting of the uniform  specifications,   QC, uncertainties, turn-around time, precision, price  etc. for all   Analysis Services</p>

<h3>Specific to version 3.0 pre-αlpha</h3>
<p>In this version the LIMS set-up area is near complete:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; "><a class="external-link" href="bika_setup/bika_calculations">Results calculations</a>,    including interim fields and dependent results, are completely user    configurable now and new calculations can be added by authorised users    without requiring programming skills</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; ">All setup items can now be de-activated, which will remove them from general view while still maintaining database integrity</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; ">Plone    4's versioning is used to maintain references to historical data in the    correct context, e.g. historical Analysis Requests will reflect the    correct historical methods, prices, units etc., after the Analysis    Service records they reference might have been modified</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; ">Plone's    change note functionality is maintained in the Bika setup, as well as    object locking to prevent more than 1 user editing the same item</p>
<p>Bika's Analysis, Analysis request and Worksheet workflows were also    reworked and are now undergoing testing. Secondary cancellation  workflow was   introduced for these 'transactional' objects too, to keep  cancelled   items in the background but traceable and DB integrity  intact</p>
<p>The user interface won't show it, but further workflow separation takes care of assigning Analyses to Worksheets, and to differentiate ARs and Worksheets awaiting results file attachments and delaying verification</p>
<p>Using Ajax, Plone 4's further improved user interface and   a host of  smaller enhancements, many clicks were saved and  general  performance  improved.</p>
<p>The main Plone index, designed to index  every bit  of of the system  in CMS style, was dismantled in favour of  more LIMS  specific indexes  to further improve performance. This work  continues</p>

<h3 class="Subheading">Known Bugs</h3>
<p>Please treat any part of the system outside of the setup area with caution as none of it has been officially tested</p>
<p>It works everywhere else, but  on Windows Firefox installations,   clicking an Analysis Profile when  creating ARs, does not stick. Please   use the keyboard arrows and  [Enter] key to select a Profile. Dragging   the cursor down onto the  desired Profile without clicking also works</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you for your support</p>
