<p>Make sure the id-server process is running before trying to add anything to the database or loading LIMS setup data.  Installing and starting the id-server will need to be done manually during testing.</p>
<p>The id-server port used (default 8081) must not be the same as the Zope port (default 8080) and must be specified in the Environment section of etc/zope.conf. If you are using a buildout-based install, you will need to add the following to [instance] in buildout.cfg:</p>
<pre>[instance]
environment-vars =
    IDServerURL http://localhost:8081
</pre>
<p>Ensure write permissions are valid for the ./var/log and ./var directories. You can start the id-server with a script as below and run it in the background.</p>
<pre>PYTHON=/usr/bin/python  ## MODIFY FOR YOUR PYTHON
#MODIFY FOR YOUR SOURCE DIRECTORY
$PYTHON bika3/bika/lims/scripts/id-server.py \
        -f var/id.counter -p 8081 T \
        -l var/log/idserver.log  -d var/idserver.pid
</pre>
<p>To test if the ID Server is running, use a web browser on the URL, eg <a href="http://localhost:8081/">http://localhost:8081</a> -- you should see an increasing integer count when you reload.</p>
