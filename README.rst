The bika.lims.legacy repo here, like the wiki, are for not maintained 

With the Ingwe Bika LIMS 4, bika.lims hosts a docker suite of Bika add-ons to a Senaite core. Bika LIMS has been packaged for years like that already. We contributed to and developed Senaite improvements, and commissioned by generous clients, a number of products that fell outside Senaite's own scope.Â These are all publicly available as Senaite add-ons have grown to a substantial set of enhancements, enough to justify a Bika release, for which the bika.lims repo is needed
