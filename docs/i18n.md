### Updating PO files from Transifex:

Install the transifex-client (tx).  Visit http://www.transifex.net/ for
more information.

Alternatively, download the PO files for your language directly from Transifex,
and replace them in the bika/lims/locales folder.

### Re-compiling PO to MO

There should be configuration in buildout.cfg to re-compile the PO files,
though sometimes it's necessary to compile them yourself:

    $ cd bika/lims/locales
    $ for po in `find . -name "*.po"`;do sudo msgfmt -o ${po/%po/mo} $po; done

### Javascript i18n (jarn.jsi18n)

If you load the site with broken translations (ie, without compiling the PO
files), jarn.jsi18n caches blank translations in browser localStorage.

In firebug, you can go to the DOM tab, search for localStorage, and
right-click/delete the bika-es, plone-es, etc, which contain "null" as their
value.

### Dates/Times

The plonelocales msgids (date_format_long, date_format_short,
date_format_short_datepicker) exist also in the bika domain.
This is the one that the bika functions use.  By default it's
configured to %Y-%m-%d %I:%M %p.

### Navigation / breadcrumbs

The items in the Navigation portlet are content - they are not managed by the
translation machine. There's a little hack in bika/lims/navtree.py to
translate them.
