### Updating PO files from Transifex:

Install the transifex-client (tx).  Visit http://www.transifex.net/ for
more information.

Alternatively, download the PO files for your language directly from Transifex,
and replace them in the bika/lims/locales folder.

### Re-compiling PO to MO

There should be configuration in buildout.cfg to re-compile the PO files,
though sometimes it's necessary to compile them yourself:

    $ cd bika/lims/locales
    $ for po in `find . -name "*.po"`;do sudo msgfmt -o ${po/%po/mo} $po; done

### Javascript i18n (jarn.jsi18n)

If you load the site with broken translations (ie, without compiling the PO
files), jarn.jsi18n caches blank translations in browser localStorage.

In firebug, you can go to the DOM tab, search for localStorage, and
right-click/delete the bika-es, plone-es, etc, which contain "null" as their
value.

### Dates/Times

Some assumptions have been made about the contents of the date_format_long,
date_format_short, date_format_short_datepicker and time_format msgids in the
plonelocales domain

- date_format_short and date_format_short_datepicker must be equivalent, though
one is a JQuery-UI format string, and the other a Python strftime format
string in TAL-notation.

### Navigation / breadcrumbs

The items in the Navigation portlet are content - they are not managed by the
translation machine. There's a little hack in bika/lims/navtree.py to
translate them.
