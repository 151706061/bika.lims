Standards

1.  Title and Description
    Use the built-in title and description fields as much as possible. 
    Modify using lowercase. e.g service.edit(title='Ash', description='blah')
    Access directly as attribute: service.title     service.description
    OR as method:                 service.Title()   service.Description()
    
    use override method to serve the title if it should be something other than
    the title - e.g the description

    security.declarePublic('Title')
    def Title(self):
        t = self.Description()
        return t and t or ''
