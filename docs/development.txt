Development setup
-----------------

You can copy development-buildout.cfg into your zinstance folder, then run:

    $ bin/buildout -c development-buildout.cfg

Miscellaneous issues
--------------------

Indent everything correctly (Especially TAL files!)

Strip trailing whitespace but leave one blank line at the end of each file.

If filestorage files have been deleted/recreated, you may need to re-create
the admin user:

    $ bin/plonectl adduser admin admin

If you don't have a mail server configured, you can use this command to start
a simple printing debug SMTP server:

    $ python -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer localhost:1025

Use the built-in Title and Description indexes and metadatas where possible!

    Modify using lowercase. e.g service.edit(title='Ash', description='blah')
    Access directly as attribute: service.title     service.description
    OR as method:                 service.Title()   service.Description()

    use override method to serve the title if it should be something other than
    the title - e.g the description:

    security.declarePublic('Title')
    def Title(self):
        t = self.Description()
        return t and t or ''
